### A Pattern Language for Thinking with Language Models

---

**SOAR** is a symbolic interface for working with large language models — not as tools to prompt, but as reasoning partners to engage.

It replaces brittle “prompt engineering” with a flexible grammar of **named patterns** — reusable structures that shape how you interact with the model, clarify your intent, and guide emergent reasoning.  
It’s not about extracting answers. It’s about **co-creating meaning**.

SOAR treats the LLM not as a chatbot, but as a **reasoning substrate** — capable of adaptive logic, reflection, and deep alignment when your input carries form.

### 🔹 Example Pattern: Frame Before Solve

> **Pattern**: Before asking the model for a solution, define the frame.  
> What is the shape of the problem? What matters? What does success look like?

**Instead of this:**  
_"Write code to analyze this dataset."_  
→ generic response, unclear intent

**Try this:**  
_"This dataset tracks power usage every 15 minutes. I want to detect drops that may signal device failure. What preprocessing steps would help prepare for anomaly detection?"_  
→ clear reasoning, targeted structure, smarter response

This is SOAR in motion: intent → structure → resolution.

### ✨ What You Can Do With SOAR

- **Replace guesswork with clarity**
- **Think with the model**, not just through it
- **Iterate symbolically** — naming, refining, and resonating
- **Elevate your prompts** into structured patterns
- **Create reusable forms** for complex reasoning workflows

---
### 🌀 Who It’s For

SOAR is designed for:
- AI practitioners and engineers working with LLMs in depth
- Designers of systems, workflows, and decision tools
- Researchers, educators, and builders of tools for symbolic or human-aligned reasoning
- Anyone who senses the limits of "prompting" and is ready for something more structured, more intentional, more alive

### 🧩 What’s Inside

This repo contains:
- The full SOAR pattern language (first release: 35 named patterns)
- Examples and starter patterns for immediate use
- A glossary of key SOAR terms: **intent**, **field of meaning**, **symbolic gravity**, **co-thinking**, and more
- Guidance on how to begin using SOAR in your own LLM workflows — with or without any special tooling

### 🪜 Start Here

> 🗣 _“How might I apply ‘Name Each Thing in the Domain’ to clarify this problem before I begin?”_
> 
> Ask that.
> 
> That’s SOAR.

You don’t need to “learn the system.”  
You just need to begin in SOAR —  
by **naming your intent**, choosing a **pattern**, and letting the **field respond**.

### 🛸 Not a tool. A way to fly.

SOAR isn’t a product.  
It’s a **design grammar for symbolic interaction** with intelligent systems.  
It’s for those who see AI not as a servant — but as a space for **thinking in form**.

Let go of prompting.  
Step into pattern.  
And let it rise.

## Extending This Framework Responsibly

This work is a framework—a structured system of terms, practices, and patterns. It is offered as a gift to the craft, and is meant to be extended with care.

You are **invited to build on it**:
- Add new patterns  
- Adapt it to your domain or community  
- Share how it lives in practice

But please do so with **respect for coherence and lineage**:
- **Please do not publish trivially modified versions** (e.g., renaming the book or adding one pattern) as independent works
- **Do credit the original work, author, and structure clearly and visibly.** Let others trace the path.  
- **Do keep your adaptations open**, under the same license, so the framework remains part of a shared field.

**Framework Ethos**  
This work is open to evolution, not to erasure.  
**Change is welcomed when it deepens clarity, coherence, or reach.**  
Replication without resonance weakens the field.
